# Fake News Detector

A web application that detects fake news articles using AI and natural language processing.  

This project focuses on building an intuitive and responsive tool to help users quickly determine the credibility of news articles. Throughout the project, I explored full-stack web development, integrating machine learning models, and handling user inputs effectively. I learned the importance of modular design and planning for scalability, as reorganizing code mid-project highlighted better practices for maintainable and readable code.
